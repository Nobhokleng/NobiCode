## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**API Key Not Working**
- Ensure your API keys are correctly set in `.env.local`
- Check that the API keys have the necessary permissions
- Verify the API key format is correct
- **Gemini**: Use `GEMINI_API_KEY` for direct Google API access
- **OpenRouter**: Use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for multi-provider access

**Model Selection Issues**
- Some models may require specific API tiers or have usage limits
- Try switching to a different model if one is unavailable
- Budget-friendly alternatives: Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o Mini
- Premium alternatives: Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview

**Streaming Not Working**
- Check your internet connection
- All models support streaming - try switching models if issues persist
- Try disabling and re-enabling streaming mode
- Clear browser cache if streaming appears stuck

**Language/Translation Issues**
- AI responses support 9 languages with optimized prompts
- UI language limited to English and Khmer for optimal user experience
- Code review quality is optimized when using English technical instructions

**UI Not Loading**
- Clear browser cache and local storage
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're using a modern browser
- Verify that at least one API key is configured
